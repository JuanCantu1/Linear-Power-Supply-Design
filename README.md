# Linear-Power-Supply-Design

# Introduction
The project was done at he University of Texas Rio Grande Valley as part of EECE 3225, Electrical Engineering Lab 1, by Juan Cantu and Kaysi Gutierrez. 

# Abstract
In this lab, we were to design a simple, unregulated AC-to-DC power supply. This involved designing a regulator circuit to form a regulated power supply. The parts of a regulated
power supply are a transformer, rectifier, filter, and regulator. The output voltage of the circuit is
dependent on the input AC voltage and the load current, as this can lead to fluctuations in the
output voltage. This is the issue that the regulator circuit addresses. It is added to maintain a
constant output voltage regardless of changes in the input voltage and load current. In this lab,
we designed an unregulated power supply and analyzed the effects of the regulator circuit.
Different load resistors were used to simulate a load and their impacts on the regulator circuit
and output voltage were analyzed. The load was measured using a multimeter to evaluate the DC
voltage output. An oscilloscope was used to monitor the AC Coupling through the peak-to-peak
ripple.

# Edquipment List
- Function Generator
- Oscilloscope
- Multimeter
- Power Transformer
- 4 Power Diodes
- Electrolytic Capacitors
- Resistors for Regulator Circuit
- Power Resistors for Load

An AC power supply is needed. A wall outlet was used, which typically supplies 250V AC.

# Part 1: Calculations
We used a full-wave bridge. The following calculations were made using data from Lab 5 and
the equations that apply to the full-wave bridge.
